# What I Build For You

## 1. Custom AI Agents

Your team spends hours triaging support tickets, qualifying leads, or pulling data from documents. An AI agent can handle that autonomously — routing requests, drafting responses, enriching records — while your people focus on work that actually needs a human.

## 2. Process Automation with AI

That manual workflow everyone hates? Document processing, report generation, data validation — I build pipelines that handle it end-to-end. You upload a file, the system does the rest.

## 3. ML Systems (Consulting + Build)

Sometimes you need a real model, not just an API call. Text classification, demand forecasting, route optimization, recommendation engines — I help identify where ML actually fits, then build and deploy it in production with proper monitoring.

## How I Work

### Discovery (Free)
30-min call to understand your problem. I'll be honest if AI isn't the right solution.

### Proposal
Clear scope and pricing. You'll know exactly what you're getting.

### Build
I ship working software, not slide decks. You see progress along the agreed timeline.

### Deliver
Production-ready system with documentation. I don't disappear after handoff.

## Pricing Model

**Base Fee + Performance Bonus**

- **Base fee**: Covers the effort and infrastructure costs
- **Performance bonus**: The larger portion — tied to agreed outcomes

If we don't hit the agreed KPIs, you don't pay the performance portion. You can walk away after base deliverables if results aren't tracking.

**Why this works:**

- Most of my fee is tied to your results
- You're not locked in — if it's not working, you stop
- I'm incentivized to deliver real outcomes, not bill hours

**Flexible alternatives:**

- Milestone-based: pay as we hit checkpoints
- Pilot first: small paid proof-of-concept before full engagement

## What I Can Tie Payment To

| Outcome | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Time saved | "Reduce manual data entry from 10 hrs/week to 1 hr/week" |
| Cost reduction | "Cut customer support costs by 30%" |
| Working prototype | "Functional AI agent handling X workflow" |
| Revenue/conversion | "Increase lead conversion by X%" |

We define these together upfront. Clear, measurable, no ambiguity.

## Why Me vs. Alternatives

| Option | What You Get |
|--------|--------------|
| **Hire full-time** | 3-6 month search, salary + benefits, management overhead |
| **Agency** | Account manager, junior developers, scope creep, slow iteration |
| **Freelancer** | Variable quality, may not have production experience |
| **Me** | Fortune 100 experience, direct accountability, outcome-aligned pricing |

**My edge:**

- I've built systems at scale that actually work in production
- I don't just consult — I deliver working systems
- Direct accountability — you always talk to me, not an account manager
- I've seen what works and what doesn't across 40+ industries at Sprinklr

---

## Ideal Clients

**Good fit:**

- Tech companies with manual, repetitive processes
- Teams that have tried automation but got stuck
- Companies that want AI but don't know where to start
- Scaling teams that need to do more without proportionally hiring

**Not a fit:**

- "We need AI for our pitch deck"
- No clear problem to solve
- Need someone to manage, not execute
