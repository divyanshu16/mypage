# Divyanshu Shekhar

Welcome! 

I’m a Machine Learning Engineer with 7+ years of experience building AI systems that power real-world products — many of which are used by Fortune 500 companies.

## About Me

I specialize in taking AI products from concept to production. Whether it’s reinforcement learning for real-time ad bidding, multilingual generative models for customer service, or robust ML pipelines deployed across distributed systems — I’ve helped scale AI efforts that make a measurable impact, with products reaching revenue 5MM$ annually and [pending patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20230078872A1/).

I enjoy working across the full stack of machine learning: from data engineering and modeling to deployment, monitoring, and iteration — always with a product mindset.

I currently work with teams and startups to:

- discover and exploration of the right/feasible use case of AI in product
- work on generative models
- Improve existing ML systems with experimentation and observability
- Design pipelines that are efficient, testable, and production-ready


## Let’s Work Together

I collaborate with companies and startups on challenging ML problems. If you’re building something interesting or need help scaling your AI efforts, feel free to [Reach Out](contact.md).
